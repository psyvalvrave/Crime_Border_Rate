# Crime_Border_Rate
I try to directly use Python to use the table on wikipedia to discover the relationship between crime rate and the distance from the U.S. border. 
I use beabutifulsoup the extract data from HTML and find the corelation. 
The entire information will be write into a csv file so we can have clear data.
